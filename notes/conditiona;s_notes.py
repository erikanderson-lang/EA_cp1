#What are conditionals in python?
#A code that uses a boolean to decide what to run

#How do we write an if statement? 
#  if stuff (other stuff)

#How do we write conditions?
# if elif else

#Why does the code need to be indented after the if?
# so it is a conditional

#Why do we want to have else statements?
#so there is still more posibility

#How many else if statements can you create? 
#three

#Why does the order of your statements matter in a conditional?
#so it knows where to read

#How do we use boolean instead of boolean statements? 
#instead of a condition just write True
